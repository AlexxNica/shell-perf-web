>GNOME Shell Performance Web Site
================================

The code in this module implements a web site to collect performance reports
generated by GNOME Shell (http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell).

Installing
==========

Copy shell/local_settings.py.example to shell/local_settings.py and edit. You'll
have to change most or all of the settings in that file.

If you are using a database backend other than MySQL, create the database.
Create the data directory and make sure the web server user has access to it.

Then run:

  cd shell
  python manager.py syncdb

[ FIXME - instructions for setting up the web server ]
