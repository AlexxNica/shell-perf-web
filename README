>GNOME Shell Performance Web Site
================================

The code in this module implements a web site to collect performance reports
generated by GNOME Shell (http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell).

Installing
==========

You'll need to have installed:

 Django version 1.1 or newer
 mod_wsgi

If using Python-2.4, you'll also need
 python-hashlib
 python-simplejson

Copy shell/local_settings.py.example to shell/local_settings.py and edit. You'll
have to change most or all of the settings in that file. local_settings.py should
be readable to the apache user but not by any untrusted users.

If you are using a database backend other than MySQL, create the database.
Create the data directory and make sure the web server user has access to it.

 mkdir <data_directory>
 mkdir <data_directory>/uploads
 sudo chown -R apache:apache <data_directory>/uploads

Then initialize the database:

 cd shell
 sudo -u apache python manager.py syncdb

Enable WSGI and add the following to your httpd configuration:

------------------------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName shell-perf.fishsoup.net

    Alias /static SRCDIR/static
    WSGIScriptAlias / SRCDIR/shell-perf.wsgi
</VirtualHost>

<Directory SRCDIR/static>
    AllowOverride None

    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
------------------------------------------------------------

Replacing SRCDIR with the directory where you have the shell-perf-web sources
checked out.
